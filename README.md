## About Manipulators AKA Robotic Arms
In robotics, a manipulator is a device used to manipulate materials without direct physical contact by the operator.The applications were originally for dealing with radioactive or biohazardous materials, using robotic arms, or they were used in inaccessible places. In more recent developments they have been used in diverse range of applications including welding automation,robotic surgery and in space. It is an arm-like mechanism that consists of a series of segments, usually sliding or jointed called cross-slides,which grasp and move objects with a number of degrees of freedom.[link to Wiki!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipulator_(device))
